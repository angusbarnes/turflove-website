            <p> TurfLove has a rich history with its original incarnation, TurfWar, taking place in early 2017. Since then, 
                the series has seen many iterations including, but not limited to: </p>

            <p> Over the years we have had many players, many worlds and many great builds. TurfLove Legacy has been a project of mine for some time now
                with the help of a senior member I have managed to successfully transplant many of the most noticeable builds into one final world. This
                is not just another 'series' - its a fullscale project and we need your help.
            </p>
            <p>
                The most dedicated community members will be given access to the Legacy SMP with the goal of finishing off many old builds and projects and continuing the legacy.
